This is about how Rockbuster Stealth management can use existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.


## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their company strategy. 
Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
