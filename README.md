This is about how Rockbuster Stealth management can use existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
